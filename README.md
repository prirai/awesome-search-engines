# Awesome Search Engines
Aiming to list all the search engines on the World Wide Web

## Search engines with own indexes

- Bing
- Google
- Mojeek
- Yandex

## Search Engines with smaller indices

- [Alexandria](https://www.alexandria.org/); A pretty new “non-profit, ad free” engine, with [freely-licensed code](https://github.com/alexandria-org/alexandria).
- [greppr](https://greppr.org/); Over 3 million pages indexed. It’s surprisingly good at finding interesting new results for broad short-tail queries, if you’re willing to scroll far enough down the page. It appears to be good at finding recent pages.
- [https://indieweb-search.jamesg.blog/](https://indieweb-search.jamesg.blog/); Search IndieWeb websites, perhaps down?
- [Right Dao](https://rightdao.com/); For the past few months, its index seems to have focused more on large, established sites rather than smaller, independent ones.
- [SeSe Engine](https://sese.yyj.moe/); Chinese engine, index seems to have a large-enough proportion of English content to fit here. [SeSe back-end Python code](https://github.com/RimoChan/sese-engine) and [the SeSe-ui Vue-based front-end](https://github.com/YunYouJun/sese-engine-ui).
- [Stract](https://trystract.com/); Stract supports advanced ranking customization by allowing users to import “optics” files, like a better version of Brave’s “goggles” feature, [open-source, AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/StractOrg/stract)
- [Yep](https://yep.com/); Excellent for less precise searches and discovery of “related sites”, especially with its index of _hundreds of billions of pages._ It’s far worse at finding very specific information or recent events for now, but it will probably improve.
